# 🏠 London Housing Analysis (2015–2025)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes London’s housing affordability trends from 2015 to 2025, focusing on the relationship between house prices, salaries, and affordability ratios.

Using SQL for data extraction and cleaning, and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard highlights how rapidly increasing house prices have outpaced salary growth, leading to record-high price-to-salary ratios.

# 🎯 Objectives

Analyze the growth of London house prices across boroughs and property types.

Compare average salary growth vs. house price growth.

Calculate price-to-salary ratios and affordability by age group.

Visualize insights in an interactive dashboard for quick exploration.


# 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

SQL → Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.

Tableau → Interactive visualizations & dashboard.

Excel/CSV → Intermediate data storage & checks.

GitHub → Project documentation & version control.



# Key Insights (2025)

📈 Average London House Price: £869,015

💷 Average Weekly Pay: £672.8

⚖️ Price-to-Salary Ratio: 24.8x

📉 Affordability (Salary vs House Price): Only 9.46%

🏘️ Detached and semi-detached homes saw the highest price growth.
